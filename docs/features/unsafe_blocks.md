# @unsafe Block Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Status

**Implementation Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND WORKING
**Total Time**: ~3 hours (faster than 6-8 hour estimate)
**Tests Passing**: 456/456 (100%)

## Summary

@unsafe blocks are now fully implemented and working as documented. Users can mark specific code blocks as unsafe to escape safety checking while keeping the rest of their function safe.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Parser (ast_visitor.rs) ✅

**File**: `src/parser/ast_visitor.rs`

Added `check_for_unsafe_annotation()` function that:
- Reads source file at entity location
- Checks previous line for `// @unsafe` comment
- Falls back to `entity.get_comment()` for some entity types
- Returns `true` if @unsafe annotation found

Modified CompoundStmt handling to:
- Check for @unsafe annotation before processing block
- Emit `Statement::EnterUnsafe` when entering unsafe block
- Emit `Statement::ExitUnsafe` when exiting unsafe block
- Proper nesting with EnterScope/ExitScope markers

### Phase 2: Analysis Tracking (mod.rs) ✅

**File**: `src/analysis/mod.rs`

Infrastructure already existed:
- `unsafe_depth` field in `OwnershipTracker` (line 957)
- `is_in_unsafe_block()` method (line 1050)
- EnterUnsafe/ExitUnsafe handling (lines 818-825)

No changes needed - it was already implemented!

### Phase 3: Unsafe Propagation (unsafe_propagation.rs) ✅

**File**: `src/analysis/unsafe_propagation.rs`

Modified `check_unsafe_propagation_with_external()`:
- Added `unsafe_depth` counter
- Track EnterUnsafe/ExitUnsafe statements
- Pass `in_unsafe_scope` flag to checking functions

Modified `check_statement_for_unsafe_calls_with_external()`:
- Added `in_unsafe_scope` parameter
- Skip all checks when `in_unsafe_scope` is true
- Pass flag through all recursive calls

### Phase 4: Tests ✅

**File**: `tests/test_dynamic_cast_in_unsafe_block.rs`

Fixed test logic:
- Changed `has_violations` check to not match "no violations found"
- Updated to check for `"violation(s):"` or presence of actual violations
- All 3 tests now passing:
  - `test_qualified_in_unsafe_block` ✅
  - `test_unqualified_in_unsafe_block` ✅
  - `test_both_in_same_unsafe_block` ✅

### Phase 5: Documentation ✅

Updated documentation:
- **UNSAFE_BLOCK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.md**: Added implementation summary and "FIXED" status
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added @unsafe blocks to "Latest Features" section
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated test count from 409 to 456

## Code Examples

### Basic Usage

```cpp
// @safe
void test() {
    // @unsafe
    {
        // All safety checks are skipped in this block
        undeclared_function();  // ✅ OK in unsafe block
        dynamic_pointer_cast<Derived>(base);  // ✅ OK in unsafe block
    }

    undeclared_function();  // ❌ ERROR: outside unsafe block
}
```

### Nested Unsafe Blocks

```cpp
// @safe
void test() {
    // @unsafe
    {
        undeclared1();  // ✅ OK

        // @unsafe  // Nested
        {
            undeclared2();  // ✅ OK
        }

        undeclared3();  // ✅ Still OK (still in outer unsafe block)
    }

    undeclared4();  // ❌ ERROR: outside all unsafe blocks
}
```

### Works with Using Namespace

```cpp
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

// @safe
void test() {
    shared_ptr<Base> base = make_shared<Derived>();

    // @unsafe
    {
        // Both qualified and unqualified work
        auto d1 = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<Derived>(base);  // ✅ OK
        auto d2 = dynamic_pointer_cast<Derived>(base);       // ✅ OK
    }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Detection Method

LibClang's `entity.get_comment()` doesn't work for CompoundStmt entities. Solution:
1. Get entity location (file path + line number)
2. Read source file
3. Check line before block for `// @unsafe` comment
4. Also support `/* @unsafe */` style

### Scope Tracking

Uses depth counter (not boolean) to support nested blocks:
- `unsafe_depth` starts at 0
- Increment on `EnterUnsafe`
- Decrement on `ExitUnsafe`
- Check `unsafe_depth > 0` to determine if in unsafe scope

### Integration Points

1. **Parser**: Detects @unsafe and emits markers in AST
2. **IR**: Converts Statement::EnterUnsafe → IrStatement::EnterUnsafe
3. **Borrow Checker**: Already had unsafe_depth tracking (no changes needed)
4. **Unsafe Propagation**: Added depth tracking and skip logic

## Files Modified

1. `src/parser/ast_visitor.rs`
   - Added `check_for_unsafe_annotation()` (70 lines)
   - Modified CompoundStmt handling (15 lines)

2. `src/analysis/unsafe_propagation.rs`
   - Modified `check_unsafe_propagation_with_external()` (20 lines)
   - Modified `check_statement_for_unsafe_calls_with_external()` (5 lines)
   - Updated recursive calls (3 locations)

3. `tests/test_dynamic_cast_in_unsafe_block.rs`
   - Fixed test logic (2 tests)

4. `UNSAFE_BLOCK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.md`
   - Updated status and added implementation summary

5. `CLAUDE.md`
   - Added @unsafe blocks to Latest Features
   - Updated test count

**Total**: 5 files, ~115 lines of new/modified code

## Test Results

### Before Implementation

```
test test_qualified_in_unsafe_block ... FAILED
test test_unqualified_in_unsafe_block ... FAILED
test test_both_in_same_unsafe_block ... FAILED
```

Error: "Calling unsafe function 'dynamic_pointer_cast (undeclared)' requires unsafe context"

### After Implementation

```
test test_qualified_in_unsafe_block ... ok
test test_unqualified_in_unsafe_block ... ok
test test_both_in_same_unsafe_block ... ok
```

Output: "✓ rusty-cpp: no violations found!"

### Full Test Suite

```
456 tests passing (up from 409)
0 failures
```

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: LibClang Comment Detection

**Problem**: `entity.get_comment()` doesn't work for CompoundStmt
**Solution**: Read source file and check line before block

### Challenge 2: Test Logic Bug

**Problem**: Test matched "no violations found" as having violations
**Solution**: Check for "violation(s):" or exclude "no violations"

### Challenge 3: Infrastructure Discovery

**Problem**: Thought Phase 2 needed implementation
**Solution**: Discovered it was already done - saved time!

## Performance Impact

Minimal performance impact:
- File reading only happens once per CompoundStmt
- Most blocks don't have @unsafe annotation
- Early return in checking functions when in unsafe scope

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements (not required):
1. Cache file reads to avoid re-reading for multiple blocks in same file
2. Support for `/* @unsafe */` on same line as `{`
3. Better error messages when @unsafe is misused

## Conclusion

@unsafe blocks are now fully functional and match Rust-like safety patterns. The implementation was straightforward because:
1. The IR already had EnterUnsafe/ExitUnsafe markers
2. The borrow checker already had unsafe_depth tracking
3. Only needed to wire up the parser and unsafe propagation

This completes the safety annotation system and resolves the user's reported issue.
