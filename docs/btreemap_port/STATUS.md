# rustc-stdlib BTreeMap Port — Status

Live tracking of the BTreeMap port effort. Updated as compile blockers
surface and get resolved (either via transpiler fixes or hand-patches).

## Goal

Take `library/alloc/src/collections/btree/` from rustc's stdlib and
produce a working `btree_port::*` C++20 module suite that the build
can link against. The discipline is **mostly transpiled, hand-patched
where the transpiler can't easily fix**. Each hand-patch must be
re-applicable (encoded in `prep.sh` here).

## How to reproduce

```bash
# 1. Copy the stdlib btree subtree.
mkdir -p /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/btree
cp -r ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/alloc/src/collections/btree/* \
   /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/btree/

# 2. Apply port-prep hand-patches.
bash docs/btreemap_port/prep.sh /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/btree

# 3. Set up the minimal Cargo crate skeleton (only ever read for
#    Cargo.toml + lib.rs paths; rustc is never invoked).
cat > /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/Cargo.toml <<EOF
[package]
name = "btree_port"
version = "0.0.1"
edition = "2021"
[lib]
path = "src/lib.rs"
EOF
cat > /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/lib.rs <<EOF
#![allow(unused)]
pub mod btree;
EOF

# 4. Transpile.
target/debug/rusty-cpp-transpiler --crate /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/Cargo.toml \
   --output-dir /tmp/btree_port/cpp_out

# 5. Build.
cd /tmp/btree_port/cpp_out
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I<path-to-rusty-lib>/include -std=c++23" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=23
cmake --build build
```

## Architectural limit — circular C++20 module dependencies

This is the dominant remaining blocker and it isn't a transpiler bug —
it's a structural mismatch between Rust's module system and C++20
modules.

**The problem.** Rust's `library/alloc/src/collections/btree/` has
cyclic dependencies between sibling files:

- `node.rs` defines `NodeRef<…>`, `Handle<…>`, `LeafNode<…>`,
  `InternalNode<…>`.
- `navigate.rs` defines `LeafRange<…>`, `LazyLeafRange<…>`,
  `Position<…>` AND adds `impl<…> NodeRef<…> { … }` orphan-impls
  that return `LeafRange` values (so node.cppm absorbs those
  methods and now references `LeafRange`).
- `search.rs`, `merge_iter.rs`, `fix.rs`, `remove.rs`, `split.rs`,
  `append.rs` all add similar orphan-impls — each ends up
  referencing types declared in its own file (or in another
  sibling) from inside methods that the injector absorbs into
  node.cppm.

In Rust this resolves cleanly because module references are name-
lookup, not compilation units. In C++20 modules each `.cppm` is a
TU, and the import graph must be a DAG. Trying to add the obvious
`import navigate;` to node.cppm produces:

```
CMake Error: Circular dependency detected in the C++ module import
graph. See modules named: "btree_port", "btree_port.btree",
"btree_port.btree.append", "btree_port.btree.fix", … (12 modules)
```

**Resolution paths.** Three options, none cheap:

1. **Merge cyclic siblings into one `.cppm`.** Concatenate
   node.rs/navigate.rs/search.rs/merge_iter.rs/fix.rs/remove.rs/
   split.rs/append.rs into a single `btree_port.btree.core.cppm`.
   The transpiler would need a "merge group" config or a coarser
   one-module-per-cycle-component mode. Loses the Rust-side
   modularity in the C++ output. Most pragmatic.

2. **Drop C++20 modules; use header-only emission.** Rewrite the
   crate-mode driver to emit `.hpp`/`.cpp` pairs with forward
   declarations and traditional include guards. Largest change
   but matches how `include/rusty/*.hpp` already works.

3. **Restructure the source to break cycles.** Move all
   `impl` blocks into the file that declares their host type, so
   `node.rs` owns every `impl NodeRef<…>` regardless of which
   sibling adds methods. Requires editing the vendored stdlib
   heavily; defeats the "transpile what's there" approach.

The hand-patch we briefly tried in iter 7 (`use super::navigate::*;`
etc. added to node.rs via prep.sh) is what surfaced the cycle —
it's been removed pending an architectural decision.

## Resolved blockers

Listed by the commit that landed the fix.

| # | Commit | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `c0c4909` | `assert!(cond, msg)` and `assert!(match …)` mis-expand in C `assert()` | Parse condition as `syn::Expr` + throw-form for message tail |
| 2 | `e44dac6` | TODO/skipped markers invisible until grep | Post-hoc scanner + `rusty_hand_slots.md` manifest |
| 3 | `ccac4dd` | `using ::node::Root;` (broken cross-module) + `pub(super)` items not exported | Sibling-module import + treat all `pub*` as `export` in module mode |
| 4 | `99fc733` | `derive(Eq, PartialEq)` emits templated defaulted operator==; `super::super` imports unresolved; `std::alloc::{Allocator,Global,AllocError}` unmapped | Concrete operator== + dedup; ancestor walk; new alloc mappings |

## Open blockers

These are the next things to fix, in order of how the compile fails.
Each is annotated with whether it looks like a transpiler bug (generic
fix) or a hand-patch (specific to the BTreeMap shape).

### Tier 1 — clear transpiler bugs

- **`auto a_next; auto b_next;` — `auto` without initializer.**
  `merge_iter.cppm:3699–3700`. Comes from Rust `let mut a_next; let
  mut b_next;` (uninitialized declarations). C++ `auto` requires an
  initializer. Fix: track uninitialized let-bindings and either emit
  `decltype(…) a_next;` (with inferred type) or initialize from the
  first assignment.

- **`std::num::NonZero` not declared.** `node.cppm:3911`. Source has
  `use core::num::NonZero;`. Mapping needs `rusty::num::NonZero<T>`
  added. Like the `Layout`/`Allocator` table, this is a single entry
  in `rewrite_std_alloc_import` (or a parallel `rewrite_std_num_import`).

- **`mem::take_mut` not a member of `mem`.** `node.cppm:4124`. The
  port has its own `mem.rs` defining `take_mut` (we saw it transpiled
  successfully in step 1). The call site references `mem::take_mut`
  but the `mem` it imports is `rusty::mem`. Should be the local
  `btree::mem::take_mut`. Likely the cross-module fix needs a
  variant for **method-style calls** (vs imports).

- **`std::println` not declared.** `node.cppm:4202`. Should map to
  `std::print`/`std::println` from `<print>` (C++23) or
  `printf`/`fmt`. Search for the call site — it's probably a
  `dbg!()` or `println!()` macro.

- **`MIN_LEN` not declared.** `node.cppm:4265, 4326`. Refers to a
  `pub(super) const MIN_LEN: usize = …` in `btree.rs` (parent
  module). Cross-module const reference — analogous to
  cross-module type references but for `const`s.

### Tier 2 — likely hand-patches

- **`MergeIter`/`MergeIterInner` referenced before declared in
  `node.cppm`.** `node.cppm:4207`. `node.rs` uses
  `super::merge_iter::MergeIter<…>`, which my cross-module fix
  should turn into an `import btree_port.btree.merge_iter`. Need
  to verify the fix is firing; if it is, the symbol may not be
  reachable because `merge_iter.cppm` itself has compile errors
  (the `auto a_next` blocker above) and so doesn't export.

- **`node` used as namespace** (`node::*` calls in node.cppm:4217).
  This is a "use the submodule as a namespace" pattern that the
  cross-module fix doesn't handle. Would need either a
  `namespace node = btree_port::btree::node;` alias after the
  import, or a separate use-emission rewrite that preserves the
  namespace-prefix shape.

### Tier 3 — fundamental gaps (likely won't bridge)

- **`NodeRef<BorrowType, K, V, Type>` type-state machinery.** The
  `Immut<'a>` / `Mut<'a>` / `ValMut<'a>` markers collapse to the
  same C++ type because lifetimes don't exist at the type level.
  Documented in the original analysis as blocker #8 of the
  empirical report. Workaround: accept the loss of borrow-state
  distinction in the C++ result. Already incurred.

## Test-count waterline

Transpiler unit tests pass at every step:

| Step | Test count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-port | 1521/1521 | Steady state at start of port |
| Step 1 (assert!) | 1524/1524 | +3 assert!-form tests |
| Step 2 (slots) | 1531/1531 | +7 slots-module tests |
| Step 3 (cross-module) | 1534/1534 | +3 sibling-module tests |
| Step 4 (op==/walk/alloc) | 1537/1537 | +3 derive-eq dedup + ancestor-sibling tests |
