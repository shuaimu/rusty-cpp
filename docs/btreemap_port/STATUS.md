# rustc-stdlib BTreeMap Port — Status

Live tracking of the BTreeMap port effort. Updated as compile blockers
surface and get resolved (either via transpiler fixes or hand-patches).

## Goal

Take `library/alloc/src/collections/btree/` from rustc's stdlib and
produce a working `btree_port::*` C++20 module suite that the build
can link against. The discipline is **mostly transpiled, hand-patched
where the transpiler can't easily fix**. Each hand-patch must be
re-applicable (encoded in `prep.sh` here).

## How to reproduce

```bash
# 1. Copy the stdlib btree subtree.
mkdir -p /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/btree
cp -r ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/alloc/src/collections/btree/* \
   /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/btree/

# 2. Apply port-prep hand-patches.
bash docs/btreemap_port/prep.sh /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/btree

# 3. Set up the minimal Cargo crate skeleton (only ever read for
#    Cargo.toml + lib.rs paths; rustc is never invoked).
cat > /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/Cargo.toml <<EOF
[package]
name = "btree_port"
version = "0.0.1"
edition = "2021"
[lib]
path = "src/lib.rs"
EOF
cat > /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/src/lib.rs <<EOF
#![allow(unused)]
pub mod btree;
EOF

# 4. Transpile.
target/debug/rusty-cpp-transpiler --crate /tmp/btree_port/btree_crate/Cargo.toml \
   --output-dir /tmp/btree_port/cpp_out

# 5. Build.
cd /tmp/btree_port/cpp_out
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I<path-to-rusty-lib>/include -std=c++23" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=23
cmake --build build
```

## Resolved blockers

Listed by the commit that landed the fix.

| # | Commit | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `c0c4909` | `assert!(cond, msg)` and `assert!(match …)` mis-expand in C `assert()` | Parse condition as `syn::Expr` + throw-form for message tail |
| 2 | `e44dac6` | TODO/skipped markers invisible until grep | Post-hoc scanner + `rusty_hand_slots.md` manifest |
| 3 | `ccac4dd` | `using ::node::Root;` (broken cross-module) + `pub(super)` items not exported | Sibling-module import + treat all `pub*` as `export` in module mode |
| 4 | `99fc733` | `derive(Eq, PartialEq)` emits templated defaulted operator==; `super::super` imports unresolved; `std::alloc::{Allocator,Global,AllocError}` unmapped | Concrete operator== + dedup; ancestor walk; new alloc mappings |

## Open blockers

These are the next things to fix, in order of how the compile fails.
Each is annotated with whether it looks like a transpiler bug (generic
fix) or a hand-patch (specific to the BTreeMap shape).

### Tier 1 — clear transpiler bugs

- **`auto a_next; auto b_next;` — `auto` without initializer.**
  `merge_iter.cppm:3699–3700`. Comes from Rust `let mut a_next; let
  mut b_next;` (uninitialized declarations). C++ `auto` requires an
  initializer. Fix: track uninitialized let-bindings and either emit
  `decltype(…) a_next;` (with inferred type) or initialize from the
  first assignment.

- **`std::num::NonZero` not declared.** `node.cppm:3911`. Source has
  `use core::num::NonZero;`. Mapping needs `rusty::num::NonZero<T>`
  added. Like the `Layout`/`Allocator` table, this is a single entry
  in `rewrite_std_alloc_import` (or a parallel `rewrite_std_num_import`).

- **`mem::take_mut` not a member of `mem`.** `node.cppm:4124`. The
  port has its own `mem.rs` defining `take_mut` (we saw it transpiled
  successfully in step 1). The call site references `mem::take_mut`
  but the `mem` it imports is `rusty::mem`. Should be the local
  `btree::mem::take_mut`. Likely the cross-module fix needs a
  variant for **method-style calls** (vs imports).

- **`std::println` not declared.** `node.cppm:4202`. Should map to
  `std::print`/`std::println` from `<print>` (C++23) or
  `printf`/`fmt`. Search for the call site — it's probably a
  `dbg!()` or `println!()` macro.

- **`MIN_LEN` not declared.** `node.cppm:4265, 4326`. Refers to a
  `pub(super) const MIN_LEN: usize = …` in `btree.rs` (parent
  module). Cross-module const reference — analogous to
  cross-module type references but for `const`s.

### Tier 2 — likely hand-patches

- **`MergeIter`/`MergeIterInner` referenced before declared in
  `node.cppm`.** `node.cppm:4207`. `node.rs` uses
  `super::merge_iter::MergeIter<…>`, which my cross-module fix
  should turn into an `import btree_port.btree.merge_iter`. Need
  to verify the fix is firing; if it is, the symbol may not be
  reachable because `merge_iter.cppm` itself has compile errors
  (the `auto a_next` blocker above) and so doesn't export.

- **`node` used as namespace** (`node::*` calls in node.cppm:4217).
  This is a "use the submodule as a namespace" pattern that the
  cross-module fix doesn't handle. Would need either a
  `namespace node = btree_port::btree::node;` alias after the
  import, or a separate use-emission rewrite that preserves the
  namespace-prefix shape.

### Tier 3 — fundamental gaps (likely won't bridge)

- **`NodeRef<BorrowType, K, V, Type>` type-state machinery.** The
  `Immut<'a>` / `Mut<'a>` / `ValMut<'a>` markers collapse to the
  same C++ type because lifetimes don't exist at the type level.
  Documented in the original analysis as blocker #8 of the
  empirical report. Workaround: accept the loss of borrow-state
  distinction in the C++ result. Already incurred.

## Test-count waterline

Transpiler unit tests pass at every step:

| Step | Test count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-port | 1521/1521 | Steady state at start of port |
| Step 1 (assert!) | 1524/1524 | +3 assert!-form tests |
| Step 2 (slots) | 1531/1531 | +7 slots-module tests |
| Step 3 (cross-module) | 1534/1534 | +3 sibling-module tests |
| Step 4 (op==/walk/alloc) | 1537/1537 | +3 derive-eq dedup + ancestor-sibling tests |
